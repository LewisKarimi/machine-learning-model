# smishing detector


Overview
Welcome to the Smishing Detector project! This machine learning-based application is designed to identify and detect smishing (SMS phishing) attempts. Smishing is a form of phishing where attackers use SMS messages to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information. It enhances cybersecurity by identifying and alerting users to potential smishing threats.

 Features
- Smishing Detection. The core functionality of the application is to analyse incoming SMS messages and determine whether they exhibit characteristics indicative of smishing.

- Real-time Analysis.The detector works in real-time, providing instant feedback on the likelihood of a message being a smishing attempt.

- User Alerts. When a potential smishing threat is detected, the user receives an alert, enabling them to exercise caution and avoid falling victim to phishing attacks.

 Technologies Used
- Machine Learning. The detection model is built using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to analyse text patterns and identify potential smishing messages.

- Natural Language Processing (NLP). The application utilizes NLP techniques to extract meaningful features from SMS messages, enhancing the accuracy of the detection model.

- Python. The project is implemented using Python, a versatile and widely used programming language in the field of machine learning.
